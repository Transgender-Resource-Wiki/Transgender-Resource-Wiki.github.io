## Introduction

&emsp; Social transitioning is all the parts of gender transitioning that aren't medical (hormones, surgery, etc.). Social transitioning involves things such as changing your pronouns, name, clothes, voice, and etc. Essentially, it is changing how you are presenting yourself to other people. It is important to know that you can do whatever parts of social transitioning you want. As an example, if you want to change everything but your voice, your identity is still valid, and likewise if you only want to change your voice and nothing else. There is no one way to transition and that you are valid regardless of what path you take (or don't take). What is important is that you are happy.

&emsp; While testosterone causes the voice to masculinize, estrogen does not feminize the voice. In order to achieve a feminine voice, voice training must be utilized. Voice training can also be utilized achieve a masculine or androgynous voice as well. Meaning that even if you don't plan to, or can't have HRT, it is still possible for you to achieve a voice that makes you happy.

## Coming Out

&emsp; Another aspect of social transitioning is coming out. Of course, it is up to **you** to decide if you want to and when you want to. Coming out can be quite intimidating, especially for the first time. If you aren't sure how a person you are planning on coming out to will react, consider gaging their views on transgender and gender noncomforming people first. A few ways to do that would be to ask them their opinion of a particular transgender celebrity, or to work the question naturally into a conversation. Once you feel safe and ready to come out to them, there a variety of ways to do it. You could just outright tell them or text them, or you could try doing something creative.

&emsp; Unfortunately there is also the possiblity that they won't be accepting. If you are planning on coming out to someone that you are dependent on, for example, your parents (especially if you are a minor), and it seems like coming out to them could endanger you, consider waiting until you are independent from them before coming out. While it is very difficult to pretend to be someone you're not, it is also much safer than potentially being abused and/or being kicked out on to the street. In the meanwhile, it is a good idea to find some support groups to help you out. There are some listed with the resources below.

Below are some resources pertaining to coming out if you'd like to read more.
