## Introduction

&emsp; Social transitioning is all the parts of gender transitioning that aren't medical (hormones, surgery, etc.). Social transitioning involves things such as changing your pronouns, name, clothes, voice, and etc. Essentially, it is changing how you are presenting yourself to other people. It is important to know that you can do whatever parts of social transitioning you want. As an example, if you want to change everything but your voice, your identity is still valid, and likewise if you only want to change your voice and nothing else. There is no one way to transition and you are valid regardless of what path you take (or don't take). What is important is that you are happy.

<span style="font-size:0.9rem;">
&emsp; Voice can be altered non-medically by voice training. If you plan on transitioning medically, testosterone will masculinize your voice, however, estrogen will not feminize it. If you want to achieve a feminine voice, or you want to take testosterone and keep a feminine voice, you can use voice training to achieve that. There is also surgery that can be done to feminize or masculinize your voice if that is something you may be interested in. There is a section on <a class="purple-link" href="#voice">voice</a> below if you are interested in reading more.

## Coming Out

&emsp; Another aspect of social transitioning is coming out. Of course, it is up to **you** to decide if you want to and when you want to. Coming out can be quite intimidating, especially for the first time. If you aren't sure how a person you are planning on coming out to will react, consider gaging their views on transgender and gender noncomforming people first. A few ways to do that would be to ask them their opinion of a particular transgender celebrity, or to work the question naturally into a conversation. Once you feel safe and ready to come out to them, there a variety of ways to do it. You could just outright tell them or text them, or you could try doing something creative.

&emsp; Unfortunately there is also the possiblity that they won't be accepting. If you are planning on coming out to someone that you are dependent on, for example, your parents (especially if you are a minor), and it seems like coming out to them could endanger you, consider waiting until you are independent from them before coming out. While it is very difficult to pretend to be someone you're not, it is also much safer than potentially being abused and/or being kicked out on to the street. In the meanwhile, it is a good idea to find some support groups to help you out. There are some listed with the resources below.

Below are some resources pertaining to coming out if you'd like to read more.

## Pronouns

&emsp; It is common for transgender and gender noncomforming people to change their pronouns. Some may change them entirely, for example, <span class="example-text-block">she/her &rarr; he/him</span> or <span class="example-text-block"> he/him &rarr; they/them</span>. Some may use a combination, for example, <span class="example-text-block">she/they</span>, <span class="example-text-block">she/he</span>, or <span class="example-text-block">he/they/she</span>. Some may also decide to use any pronouns, no pronouns, or they might not change them at all. Neopronouns such as <span class="example-text-block">xe/xem/xirs</span> or <span class="example-text-block">fae/faer/faers</span> are also used by some as well, but they are not very common. It is up to you if you want to change your pronouns and what to change them to. Your decision is not permanent and if you end up not liking the pronouns you chose you can totally change them again. If you aren't sure about using certain pronouns, and feel safe to do so, you can ask people to try using those pronouns to see if you like being called them. Even if you are sure, it can still be very euphoric to be called the pronouns you want to be called. There are many online communities for transgender and gender nonconforming people that would be happy to help you try out pronouns as well.
