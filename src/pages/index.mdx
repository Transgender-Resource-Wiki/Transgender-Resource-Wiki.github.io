<h1 style="text-align:center; font-weight:normal;">Welcome to the Transgender Resource Library</h1>

---

&emsp; The Transgender Resource Library contains collections of resources and other information
pertinent to transgender people, as well as to their allies. The Transgender Resource Library
was inspired by the sidebar wikis on sites such as Lemmy and Reddit. While those wikis are important
resources for many, they also have some flaws, in that they are limited with how they can be 
organized, and they often contain links to posts, some of which are deleted. This website aims
to provide helpful resources just like those wikis, but with improved organization and with
archives to help ensure that information isn't lost.

&emsp; Navigation to the content on the Transgender Resource Library can be found on the left for
desktop users and in the top right corner for mobile users.
