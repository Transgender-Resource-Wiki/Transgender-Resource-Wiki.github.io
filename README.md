Hello!

&emsp; My name is Lumelore, and I am currently the sole developer of the TRL. I am making this website as I would like to give back to the community, which has helped me out a lot over the years. I am transgender, and also a computer science student. Although I am not studying web development in college, I have been learning on my own as I make this website.

Thanks for checking out the Transgender Resource Library!
